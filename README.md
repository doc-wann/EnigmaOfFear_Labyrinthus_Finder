A very small script for Labyrinthus navigation on the Enigma of Fear game ;)

It works the following way:
Setup a game directory, by standard I used steam

directory_path = "D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Enigma of Fear\Labyrinthus"

then, execute the program using python ./findfile

it will simply return a list of file paths to everything that does not contain the standard uh-oh in the selected folder ;)
